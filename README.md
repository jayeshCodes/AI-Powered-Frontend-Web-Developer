## Project Overview
The goal is to build a model that:
- Continuously learns from GitHub repositories.
- Generates functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Deploys the generated websites to a cloud platform.

## Features
- **Continuous Learning:** Periodically fetches new repositories for ongoing training.
- **Code Generation:** Generates complete web pages from the learned code snippets.
- **Automated Deployment:** Uses CI/CD pipelines to deploy the generated websites.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **GitHub API:** For accessing public repositories
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Web Hosting Services:** Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, GitHub Pages

## Architecture
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Fetch repositories using the GitHub API.
   - Extract HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the extracted code.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train a language model (e.g., GPT-3) on the preprocessed data.

4. **Continuous Learning:**
   - Periodically update the model with new data.

5. **Website Generation:**
   - Synthesize code snippets into complete web pages.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process.
